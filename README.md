## Description

The Social Network API is a robust backend application that provides a set of powerful API routes for managing users, thoughts, reactions, and friend connections. It seamlessly integrates with a MongoDB database using Mongoose models, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

### Key Features:

- **Server Initialization:** When you invoke the application, the server is started, and the Mongoose models are synchronized with the MongoDB database.
- **API Routes:** The application offers a comprehensive set of API routes for performing various operations, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for users, thoughts, reactions, and friend connections.
- **CRUD Operations:** Through Insomnia, you can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with ease. This includes creating and updating users, friends, reactions and thoughts.
- **Friend Management:** The API allows you to add and remove friends to a user's friend list, facilitating social interactions within the platform.
- **Thought Deletion:** When a user is deleted, their associated thoughts are also automatically removed, ensuring data consistency.
- **Testing with Insomnia:** Effortlessly test API routes in Insomnia to verify functionality and data integrity.
